# /by-ai:commit - Creator commit message for current changes

## Purpose

This command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages.

## Usage

```
/by-ai:commit
```

Or with options:

```
/by-ai:commit --no-verify
```

## What This Command Does

1. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks
2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`
3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed

## Best Practices for Commits

- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters


## Examples

Good commit messages:

- feat: add user authentication system
- fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process
- docs: update API documentation with new endpoints
- refactor: simplify error handling logic in parser
- fix: resolve linter warnings in component files
- chore: improve developer tooling setup process
- feat: implement business logic for transaction validation
- fix: address minor styling inconsistency in header
- fix: patch critical security vulnerability in auth flow
- style: reorganize component structure for better readability
- fix: remove deprecated legacy code
- feat: add input validation for user registration form
- fix: resolve failing CI pipeline tests
- feat: implement analytics tracking for user engagement
- fix: strengthen authentication password requirements
- feat: improve form accessibility for screen readers

## Command Options

- `--no-verify`: Skip running the pre-commit checks (lint, build, generate:docs)

## Important Notes

- By default, pre-commit checks will run to ensure code quality
- If these checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed with the commit anyway or fix the issues first
- If specific files are already staged, the command will only commit those files
- If no files are staged, it will automatically stage all modified and new files
- The commit message will be constructed based on the changes detected
- Before committing, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple commits would be more appropriate
- Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes
