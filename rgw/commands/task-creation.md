Generate task files from the requirements.yaml file without executing them.

- create a list of tasks, as defined in `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/prompt-collection/rgw/context/workflow/task-generation.md`.
- IMPORTANT: Each task must be in a separate file (task-001.yaml, task-002.yaml, etc.). Each task file contains multiple steps within it.
- after the task list is generated, your work is done. DO NOT start working on the tasks!
